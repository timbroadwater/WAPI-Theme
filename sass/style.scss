// Settings – font, colors definitions, etc.
@import "_partials/ui";

//Tools – globally used mixins and functions
@import "_partials/mixins";

//Generic – reset and/or normalize styles, box-sizing definition, etc.
@import "_partials/reset";

//Elements – styling for bare HTML elements (like H1, A, etc.). These come with default styling from the browser so we can redefine them here.

//Objects – class-based selectors which define undecorated design patterns, for example media object known from OOCSS

//Components – specific UI components. This is where majority of our work takes place and our UI components are often composed of Objects and Components

//Trumps – utilities and helper classes with ability to override anything which goes before in the triangle, eg. hide helper class
